# Why?

- **Maintainability:** Code adhering to SOLID principles tends to be easier to maintain because itâ€™s modular, less tightly coupled, and easier to understand.
- **Flexibility:** The principles promote flexibility by allowing easier changes, extensions, and adaptations without affecting the entire codebase.
- **Readability:** Code following these principles tends to be more readable and understandable, making it easier for developers to collaborate, maintain, and debug. [^2]
